3. Print the list of all shells available in the system.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get the list of shells from /etc/shells

while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo "$line"
done < /etc/shells
```
```bash
/mnt/c/Users/yadav.deepak/Desktop/practise$ ./test.sh
# /etc/shells: valid login shells
/bin/sh
/bin/bash
/usr/bin/bash
/bin/rbash
/usr/bin/rbash
/usr/bin/sh
/bin/dash
/usr/bin/dash
/usr/bin/tmux
/usr/bin/screen
```

4. Create a script that prints the current directory using a command shortcut.

6. Use history expansion to repeat the last command in a script.
7. Display script name and number of arguments passed.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Script Name : $0"
echo "Number of arguments : $#"
```

```bash
deepak@LG7G0DB3:/mnt/c/Users/yadav.deepak/Desktop/practise$ ./test.sh
Script Name : ./test.sh
Number of arguments : 0
deepak@LG7G0DB3:/mnt/c/Users/yadav.deepak/Desktop/practise$ ./test.sh Deepak
Script Name : ./test.sh
Number of arguments : 1
deepak@LG7G0DB3:/mnt/c/Users/yadav.deepak/Desktop/practise$ 
```

8. Write a script to display current shell type using `$SHELL`.

``` Refer Question 2 ```

9. Show all environment variables from a script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Environment Variables: $(env)" | sort
```

10. Use alias in a script to replace `ls -l` with `ll`.

```bash

```

11. Create a script and run it with `bash script.sh` and `./script.sh`. Observe differences.

 Let's walk through this step-by-step to understand the differences between:

* Running a script via: `bash script.sh`
* Running a script via: `./script.sh`

---

### üìù Step 1: Create a test script

Create a script named `script.sh` with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Current shell: $SHELL"
echo "Script executed with: $0"
```

Save the file in your directory.

---

### üß™ Step 2: Run the script both ways

#### ‚úÖ Method 1: `bash script.sh`

```bash
bash script.sh
```

#### ‚úÖ Method 2: `./script.sh`

First, make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```

---

### üîç Expected Output Comparison

#### Output of `bash script.sh`:

```
Current shell: /bin/bash
Script executed with: script.sh
```

#### Output of `./script.sh`:

```
Current shell: /bin/bash
Script executed with: ./script.sh
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è What's the Difference?

| Aspect                     | `bash script.sh`                              | `./script.sh`                                      |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interpreter**            | Uses explicitly `bash`, regardless of shebang | Uses shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) to decide interpreter |
| **\$0 value**              | `script.sh`                                   | `./script.sh`                                      |
| **Execution**              | Script run **as a parameter** to bash         | Script run **as an executable file**               |
| **Exec permission needed** | ‚ùå Not needed                                  | ‚úÖ Required (`chmod +x`)                            |
| **Overrides shebang?**     | ‚úÖ Yes                                         | ‚ùå No, it uses it                                   |

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

* Use `bash script.sh` if you're debugging or testing with a specific shell.
* Use `./script.sh` to execute the script like a standalone program (respects shebang).
* Both are valid, but behave slightly differently in how they pass arguments and set `$0`.



12. Store the output of `pwd` in a variable and print it.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

current_working_directory=$(pwd)
echo "Current Working Directory: $current_working_directory"
````

13. Write a script to check whether the current shell is interactive or not.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if shell is interactive
case $- in
  *i*) 
    echo "The shell is interactive."
    ;;
  *)  
    echo "The shell is NOT interactive."
    ;;
esac
```

```bash
deepak@LG7G0DB3:/mnt/c/Users/yadav.deepak/Desktop/practise$ ./test.sh
The shell is NOT interactive.
```

14. Use `basename` and `dirname` to get filename and path from a full path.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if shell is interactive
directory="$(pwd)/test.sh"
echo "Current directory: $directory"

echo "File: $(basename $directory)"
echo "Path: $(dirname $directory)"
```
```bash
deepak@LG7G0DB3:/mnt/c/Users/yadav.deepak/Desktop/practise$ ./test.sh
Current directory: /mnt/c/Users/yadav.deepak/Desktop/practise/test.sh
File: test.sh
Path: /mnt/c/Users/yadav.deepak/Desktop/practise
```

15. üßë‚Äçüíº **Real-time**: Create a bootstrap shell script that prints basic system info like hostname, IP, OS, shell.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hostname: $(hostname)"
echo "IP Address: $(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')"
echo "Operating System: $(uname -s)"
echo "Kernel Version: $(uname -r)"
echo "Shell Type: $SHELL"
```
```bash
deepak@LG7G0DB3:/mnt/c/Users/yadav.deepak/Desktop/practise$ ./test.sh
Hostname: LG7G0DB3
IP Address: 172.25.99.183
Operating System: Linux
Kernel Version: 6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2
Shell Type: /bin/bash
```

 > Understanding `<`, `< <(...)`, and `IFS` will make your Bash scripting much more powerful and reliable.

---

### ‚úÖ `IFS` ‚Äì Internal Field Separator

#### üìå What it is:

* `IFS` is a **special shell variable** (not a keyword) used by Bash to **split strings** into words/tokens.

#### üîß Default value:

```bash
IFS=" \t\n"  # space, tab, newline
```

#### üîÑ When reading files:

If you don‚Äôt override `IFS`, Bash will split lines on spaces/tabs too ‚Äî which may **break filenames** with spaces.

#### ‚úÖ Usage in your script:

```bash
while IFS= read -r line; do ...
```

* `IFS=` ‚Üí disables word splitting completely.
* `read -r` ‚Üí disables interpretation of backslashes (`\`).
* ‚úÖ This is **best practice** when reading lines or filenames reliably.

---

### ‚úÖ `<` vs `< <(...)` vs `<<`

| Syntax          | Name                 | Use Case                                                                |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cmd < file`    | Input redirection    | Feed the contents of `file` as input to `cmd` or a loop                 |
| `cmd < <(...)`  | Process substitution | Feed the output of a command (like `find`) into another command or loop |
| `<<EOF ... EOF` | Here Document        | Provide multiline **inline input** in a script                          |

---

### üîç Examples

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `<` ‚Äì Input from a file

```bash
while read line; do
    echo "$line"
done < myfile.txt
```

‚úÖ Reads from a file line by line.

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `< <(...)` ‚Äì Process substitution

```bash
while read line; do
    echo "$line"
done < <(ls /tmp)
```

‚úÖ Takes **output** of `ls /tmp` and feeds it to the loop.

---

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ `<<` ‚Äì Here document

```bash
cat <<EOF
Hello Deepak
This is a test.
EOF
```

‚úÖ Used when you want to pass **multiple lines of text** as input.

---

### üîë Summary

| Symbol     | Description                                  | Typical Use Case                                 |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `< file`   | Input redirection                            | Read from a file                                 |
| `< <(...)` | **Process substitution**                     | Read from **command output**                     |
| `<<EOF`    | **Here document** (inline multiline content) | Simulate file input or feed data to a command    |
| `IFS`      | Word-splitting behavior for `read` etc.      | Set to empty (`IFS=`) to prevent unwanted splits |

Enter the Num 2: 11
Both numbers are equal.
```

6. Write a login script: if username == "admin", print "Welcome admin".
```bash
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter the name : " name

if [[ "$name" == "admin" ]]; then
    echo "Welcome, $name!"
else
    echo "Access denied."
fi
```
```bash
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Enter the name : admin
Welcome, admin!
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Enter the name : Deepak
Access denied.
```

7. Use `[[ ... ]]` to test a string contains a substring.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

str="DevOps with Deepak"
[[ $str == *Deepak* ]] && echo "Found"
```
```bash
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Found
```

8. Use `&&` to run a second command only if the first succeeds.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

str="DevOps with Deepak"
[[ $str == *Deepak* ]] && echo "Found"
[[ $str == *NotFound* ]] && echo " Not Found"
```
```bash
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Found
```

9. Use `||` to provide fallback if a command fails.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

str="DevOps with Deepak"
[[ $str == *Deepak* ]] && echo "Found"
[[ $str == *NotFound* ]] || echo "Not Found"
```
```bash
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Found
Not Found
```

10. Use `!` to reverse a condition in an if block.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

str="DevOps with Deepak"
if [[ $str == *Deepak* ]] ; then 
    echo "Found"
elif [[ $str != *DevOps* ]] ; then 
    echo "Not Found DevOps"
else
    echo "Nothing Found"
fi

```

```bash
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Found
^Cepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ^C
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Nothing Found
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Not Found DevOps
```

11. Check if a file is readable and writable.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [[ -r testt.sh && -w test.sh ]]; then
    echo "The file test.sh is readable and writable."
else
    echo "The file test.sh is not readable or writable."
fi
```
```bash
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
The file test.sh is readable and writable.
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
The file test.sh is not readable or writable.
```

12. Write a script to compare two user-input numbers and print the larger.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter the num1 : " num1
read -p "Enter the num2 : " num2

((( num1 > num2 )) && echo "Number1 $num1 is greater") || \
((( num1 < num2 )) && echo "Number2 $num2 is greater") || \
echo "Both numbers are equal"
```
```bash
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Enter the num1 : 11
Enter the num2 : 11
Both numbers are equal
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Enter the num1 : 22
Enter the num2 : 11
Number1 22 is greater
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Enter the num1 : 11
Enter the num2 : 22
Number2 22 is greater
```

13. Write a script to print a grade based on score using `if-elif-else`.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter your score (0-100): " score

if [[ ! "$score" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
    echo "Invalid input. Please enter a numeric score."
    exit 1

# Check if score is in the valid range
elif (( score < 0 || score > 100 )); then
    echo "Invalid score. Please enter a value between 0 and 100."
    exit 1

# Determine the grade based on the score
elif (( score >= 90 && score <= 100 )); then
    echo "Grade: A"
elif (( score >= 80 )); then
    echo "Grade: B"
elif (( score >= 70 )); then
    echo "Grade: C"
elif (( score >= 60 )); then
    echo "Grade: D"
else 
    echo "Grade: F"
fi

```

```bash
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Enter your score (0-100): 
Invalid input. Please enter a numeric score.
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Enter your score (0-100): 200
Invalid score. Please enter a value between 0 and 100.
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Enter your score (0-100): 100
Grade: A
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Enter your score (0-100): 45
Grade: F
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Enter your
```
14. Use `case` statement to match input with options: start, stop, restart.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter action (start | stop | restart): " action

case "$action" in
    start)
        echo "Service is starting..."
        ;;
    stop)
        echo "Service is stopping..."
        ;;
    restart)
        echo "Service is restarting..."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Invalid action. Please enter start, stop, or restart."
        ;;
esac

```

```bash
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Enter action (start | stop | restart): start
Service is starting...
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Enter action (start | stop | restart): restart
Service is restarting...
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Enter action (start | stop | restart): stop
Service is stopping...
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Enter action (start | stop | restart): WrongInput
Invalid action. Please enter start, stop, or restart.
```

15. üßë‚Äçüíº **Real-time**: Validate if a config file exists, is readable, and has a non-zero size.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter the config file path: " config_file

if [[ -f "$config_file" && -r "$config_file" && -s "$config_file" ]]; then
    echo " '$config_file' exists, is a regular readable file, and is not empty."
else
    echo " File check failed:"
    [[ ! -f "$config_file" ]] && echo "   - File does not exist or is not a regular file."
    [[ -f "$config_file" && ! -r "$config_file" ]] && echo "   - File is not readable."
    [[ -f "$config_file" && -r "$config_file" && ! -s "$config_file" ]] && echo "   - File is empty."
fi

```
```bash
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Enter the config file path: test.sh
 'test.sh' exists, is a regular readable file, and is not empty.
deepak@DeepakRK:/mnt/d/Study/Linux/shell Scripting/Scripts$ ./test.sh 
Enter the config file path: rest.sh
 File check failed:
   - File does not exist or is not a regular file.
```
